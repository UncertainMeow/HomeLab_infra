## 📋 Project Overview & Context

### What This Project Is
A **production-ready Ansible-based infrastructure automation suite** for managing a Proxmox homelab with AI/ML capabilities. The project successfully deploys GitLab CE with Caddy reverse proxy, DNS management, and comprehensive security hardening.

### User's Primary Goals
1. **Automate homelab infrastructure** using Ansible best practices
2. **Deploy GitLab CE stack** for version control and CI/CD workflows
3. **Implement bulletproof security** with no hardcoded passwords
4. **Create scalable architecture** ready for future expansion (Semaphore, Kestra, k3s)
5. **Maintain comprehensive documentation** for operations and expansion

## ✅ What We Accomplished (Phase 1)

### 🏗️ **Infrastructure Deployed Successfully**
- **GitLab CE** running on rawls with Docker Compose
- **Caddy reverse proxy** with automatic HTTPS and Tailscale magic domains  
- **Technitium DNS server** deployed on rseau for internal domain management
- **Multi-layer security hardening** (UFW firewall, fail2ban, SSH restrictions)
- **Automated backup systems** with retention policies

### 🔒 **CRITICAL: Bulletproof Security Implementation**
**Problem Found & Fixed:**
- **DISCOVERED:** Multiple hardcoded passwords in roles (`GitLabAdmin123!`, `TechAdmin123!`, etc.)
- **SOLUTION:** Replaced ALL hardcoded secrets with Ansible Vault patterns
- **IMPLEMENTED:** Dynamic password generation with secure fallbacks
- **DOCUMENTED:** Comprehensive `SECRETS-MANAGEMENT.md` guide

**Security Pattern Applied:**
```yaml
# BEFORE (INSECURE - NEVER DO THIS)
gitlab_root_password: "GitLabAdmin123!"

# AFTER (PRODUCTION-READY)  
gitlab_root_password: "{{ vault_gitlab_root_password | default(lookup('password', '/dev/null length=20 chars=ascii_letters,digits,punctuation')) }}"
```

```

### 🧪 **Quality Assurance Completed**
- **✅ All playbooks syntax validated** with `ansible-playbook --syntax-check`
- **✅ Inventory structure verified** with proper host groups
- **✅ Role dependencies resolved** and tested
- **✅ Git repository organized** with proper commit history
- **✅ Documentation comprehensive** and up-to-date

---

## 🎯 Current Status & Next Steps

### **Immediate Status (Ready to Deploy)**
- **Repository:** All code committed and pushed to GitHub (`commit e96c759`)
- **Playbooks:** Production-ready and syntax-validated
- **Security:** Bulletproof - no hardcoded secrets remain  
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive guides available

### **🔥 URGENT: Before Next Deployment**
1. **Set up Ansible Vault** - User MUST create encrypted vault file:
   ```bash
   cd ansible-infrastructure
   ansible-vault create inventory/group_vars/all/vault.yml
   # Use template at inventory/group_vars/all/vault.yml.template
   ```

2. **Configure SSH Access** - Verify 1Password SSH Agent working:
   ```bash
   ssh-add -l  # Should show available keys
   ansible all -m ping  # Test connectivity
   ```

## 📅 Next 2-3 Days Roadmap

### **Day 1: Deployment Validation & Testing**
**Priority: HIGH** - Ensure current stack is rock-solid before expansion

#### Morning Tasks:
- [ ] **Vault Setup** - Help user create encrypted vault with real secrets
- [ ] **Connectivity Test** - Validate SSH access to all hosts
- [ ] **Deploy GitLab Stack** - Run full deployment and verify functionality
  ```bash
  cd ansible-infrastructure
  ansible-playbook playbooks/deployment/gitlab-stack.yml
  ```

#### Afternoon Tasks:
- [ ] **DNS Validation** - Deploy and test Technitium DNS server

#### Integration Points:
```yaml
# Enable in gitlab_stack role
enable_semaphore: true
semaphore_gitlab_integration: true
```

#### Templates to Create:
- `templates/semaphore-compose.yml.j2`
- `templates/semaphore-config.json.j2`
- Caddy configuration updates for reverse proxy

**Success Criteria:** Semaphore UI accessible, can execute existing playbooks through web interface, GitLab integration functional.

### **Day 3: Monitoring & Phase 3 Planning**
**Priority: MEDIUM** - Observability and future workflow orchestration

#### Morning: Monitoring Setup
- [ ] **Prometheus + Grafana** - Add monitoring stack to infrastructure
- [ ] **Service Health Checks** - Implement comprehensive monitoring

## 🛠️ Technical Context for Next Agent

### **Critical Files to Understand**
1. **`ansible-infrastructure/ansible.cfg`** - Centralized configuration
2. **`ansible-infrastructure/inventory/hosts.yml`** - Infrastructure definition  
3. **`roles/gitlab_stack/`** - Complete GitLab deployment automation
4. **`SECRETS-MANAGEMENT.md`** - Security implementation guide
5. **`CLAUDE.md`** - Project context and operational commands

### **Working Directory Pattern**
⚠️ **ALWAYS work from `ansible-infrastructure/` directory** - contains centralized config and inventory.

### **Common Commands**
```bash
# Navigate to working directory
cd ansible-infrastructure

# Test connectivity  
ansible all -m ping

# Deploy GitLab stack
ansible-playbook playbooks/deployment/gitlab-stack.yml

# Deploy DNS server
ansible-playbook playbooks/deployment/technitium-dns-container.yml  

# System maintenance
ansible-playbook playbooks/maintenance/system-update.yml
```

### **Security Patterns**
- **NEVER** hardcode passwords in YAML files
- **ALWAYS** use vault patterns: `{{ vault_variable | default(lookup('password', '/dev/null length=20')) }}`
- **ENCRYPT** all secrets with `ansible-vault encrypt`
- **VALIDATE** with `ansible-playbook --syntax-check` before deployment

---

## 🚨 Known Issues & Gotchas

### **SSH Authentication**
- **Issue:** User occasionally needs to manually fix ansible user setup on hosts
- **Solution:** SSH keys managed via 1Password SSH Agent - verify with `ssh-add -l`
- **Backup:** Manual key deployment may be needed after host reboots

### **Docker Compose Version**
- **Issue:** Some hosts have v1 syntax (`docker-compose`) vs v2 (`docker compose`)  
- **Handled:** Deployment scripts check version and adapt accordingly

### **DNS Network Binding**
- **Issue:** Initial DNS deployment tried to bind to non-existent container IP
- **Fixed:** Now properly binds to host IP (rseau: 10.203.1.2)

### **Inventory Parsing**
- **Requirement:** Must use centralized `ansible-infrastructure/ansible.cfg`
- **Pattern:** Always run commands from ansible-infrastructure/ directory
